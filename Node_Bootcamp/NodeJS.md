# Node JS Notes

## Use cases for NodeJS

* Single-threaded, based on event driven, non-blocking I/O model
* Perfect for building fast and scalable data-intensive apps.
* API with database behind it (preferably NoSQL).
* Data streaming (like YouTube)
* Real time chat application
* Server-side web application.
* JavaScript across the entire stack: faster and more efficient development
* NPM: huge library of open source packages available for everyone for free.
* Very active developer community


Don't use (typically):

* Application with heavy server side processing (CPU-intensive) - Better ot use Ruby on Rails, PHP, or Python.
